# Python teachings
This repo is meant as a place to write down a somewhat more concrete and structured "plan" for teaching kids how to program in Python.

## Teaching plan
These (hopefuly quite concrete) thoughts about teaching kids Python are structured in a sort of "teachings per evening" so that it'll hopefully be more managable to teach the kids about this topic.

The below "teaching plan" is, therefore, not thought of as a plan that absolutely need to follow step by step in order to teach kids Python. The general idea is more that this plan can be used as way of more easily getting started teaching kids about Python.

In short: do whatever you like and if people can use this repo for inspiration then .. great.

### Evening #1
As kids probably won't be interested in hearing about stuff like "Python was developed by a guy named Guido van Rossum and .. blah, blah, blah", then it might be a good idea to get them started by following these topics for starters.

#### Start with a minor seeesion of "show and tell"
But before diving straight into coding it could be wise to both ask and show them what Python is, how we write it and what we can do with it. Perhaps like this:
1. Ask them what a programming language is (to get them to think about that - at least)
2. Show them that it's just some weird language we write in an IDE that tells the computer to do as we say
3. Show them what one can do with Python (like code some stuff, obviously, create games, automate stuff, web scrape stuff and so on

#### Download Python and VS Code
From this - hopefully good - starting point one would obviously need to get the kids to download the following so that they can start coding:
1. Download Python
2. Download VS Code
