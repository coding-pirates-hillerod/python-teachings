# Python undervisning
Dette repo er ment som et sted til at skrive en mere eller mindre konkret og struktureret "plan" til at undervise b√∏rn i at programmere i Python.

## Teaching plan
These (hopefuly quite concrete) thoughts about teaching kids Python are structured in a sort of "teachings per evening" so that it'll hopefully be more managable to teach the kids about this topic.

A sort of "teaching plan per evening" can, therefore, be found under the "lecturees" folder. It is not thought of as a plan that one absolutely need to follow step by step in order to teach kids Python. The general idea is more that this plan can be used as way of more easily getting started teaching kids about Python.

In short: do whatever you like and if people can use this repo for inspiration then .. great.
