# Evening #2
Based on the first evening of teaching, this second evening will go through the following:
1. Type casting
2. Strings
3. etc (for now ..)

## Show and tell: The 'type' function
As the 1st evening covered variables, data types and a brief walkthrough of some of Python's built-in functions it might just be wise to show the kids something about the built-in 'type' function as this would naturally spill over into the next topic of 'type casting'

Hence, an example of the 'type' could be this:
```python
integer = 10
print(type(integer))

decimal = 20.75
print(type(decimal))

text = "Hey .. I'm of the data type 'string'"
print(type(text))

boolean = True
print(type(boolean))
```
